# Video Detection Pipeline Optimization

## Summary of Changes

We've optimized the video detection pipeline in the content script to create a more efficient, streamlined workflow with the following key improvements:

### 1. Removed Batch Processing

- Eliminated all queuing and batch processing mechanisms
- Implemented direct processing of videos as they're detected
- Created unified flow through the `processVideo()` function

### 2. Enhanced Deduplication with WeakSet Tracking

- Added `observedVideoElements` WeakSet to track video elements without memory leaks
- Improved element tracking in `processNewVideoElement` function
- Ensured video elements are only processed once

### 3. Optimized Validation and Normalization

- Enhanced `validateVideo()` to perform early normalization
- Added early duplicate detection to avoid unnecessary processing
- Improved URL normalization with more comprehensive parameter filtering
- Consolidated type identification, validation and normalization in one function

### 4. Simplified Detection Flow

- Streamlined network interception in XHR and Fetch
- Unified DOM observation handling with better element tracking
- Removed redundant code paths and simplified message handling

### 5. Improved Video Processing

- Created a consistent path for all detected videos
- Enhanced handling of blob URLs
- Implemented more thorough validation of URL parameters
- Improved metadata extraction from video elements

### 6. Better Type Detection

- Enhanced video type detection patterns
- Added more robust handling of streaming formats
- Improved extraction of videos from query parameters

### 7. Navigation Handling

- Added navigation state clearing to prevent stale data
- Implemented History API monitoring to detect SPA navigation
- Created proper cleanup for page transitions

## Latest Changes (Phase 2)

1. **Simplified `extractVideoInfo()`**

   - Now only extracts raw data without validation
   - Separation of concerns: extraction vs validation

2. **Enhanced `processVideo()`**

   - Now handles all video types in one place
   - Merged blob URL processing into main function
   - Auto-detects type when not provided

3. **Removed `processBlobURL()`**

   - Functionality merged into `processVideo()`
   - Reduced code duplication and simplified flow

4. **Simplified `isVideoContent()`**

   - Now leverages `identifyVideoType()` logic
   - Eliminated code duplication
   - More consistent behavior across pipeline

5. **Improved Error Handling**

   - Added better error handling throughout pipeline
   - More robust handling of edge cases

6. **Added Navigation Handling**
   - Clear state on page navigation
   - Support for SPA (Single Page Applications)
   - History API monitoring for state cleanup

## Architecture Flow

The new optimized pipeline works as follows:

1. **Detection**: Videos are discovered via DOM observation or network interception
2. **Extraction**: Raw video data is extracted without validation or processing
3. **Processing**: Central `processVideo()` function handles all video types
4. **Validation**: Each video is validated, normalized and deduplicated in `validateVideo()`
5. **Background**: Valid videos are sent to background script
6. **Tracking**: Processed videos are tracked in `state.detectedVideos` to prevent duplicates
7. **Element Tracking**: Processed video elements are tracked in `state.observedVideoElements`
8. **Navigation**: State is cleared on page navigation to prevent stale data

This new architecture ensures that only valid, unique videos are processed and reported to the background script, improving performance and reducing unnecessary processing. 4. **Tracking**: Processed videos are tracked in `state.detectedVideos` to prevent duplicates 5. **Element Tracking**: Processed video elements are tracked in `state.observedVideoElements`

This new architecture ensures that only valid, unique videos are processed and reported to the background script, improving performance and reducing unnecessary processing.
