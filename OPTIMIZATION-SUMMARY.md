# Video Detection Pipeline Optimization

## Summary of Changes

We've optimized the video detection pipeline in the content script to create a more efficient, streamlined workflow with the following key improvements:

### 1. Removed Batch Processing

- Eliminated all queuing and batch processing mechanisms
- Implemented direct processing of videos as they're detected
- Created unified flow through the `processVideo()` function

### 2. Enhanced Deduplication with WeakSet Tracking

- Added `observedVideoElements` WeakSet to track video elements without memory leaks
- Improved element tracking in `processNewVideoElement` function
- Ensured video elements are only processed once

### 3. Optimized Validation and Normalization

- Enhanced `validateVideo()` to perform early normalization
- Added early duplicate detection to avoid unnecessary processing
- Improved URL normalization with more comprehensive parameter filtering
- Consolidated type identification, validation and normalization in one function

### 4. Simplified Detection Flow

- Streamlined network interception in XHR and Fetch
- Unified DOM observation handling with better element tracking
- Removed redundant code paths and simplified message handling

### 5. Improved Video Processing

- Created a consistent path for all detected videos
- Enhanced handling of blob URLs
- Implemented more thorough validation of URL parameters
- Improved metadata extraction from video elements

### 6. Better Type Detection

- Enhanced video type detection patterns
- Added more robust handling of streaming formats
- Improved extraction of videos from query parameters

## Architecture Flow

The new optimized pipeline works as follows:

1. **Detection**: Videos are discovered via DOM observation or network interception
2. **Validation**: Each video is validated, normalized and deduplicated in `validateVideo()`
3. **Processing**: Valid videos are sent to background through `processVideo()`
4. **Tracking**: Processed videos are tracked in `state.detectedVideos` to prevent duplicates
5. **Element Tracking**: Processed video elements are tracked in `state.observedVideoElements`

This new architecture ensures that only valid, unique videos are processed and reported to the background script, improving performance and reducing unnecessary processing.
