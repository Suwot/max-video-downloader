# Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç Common Issues

### Extension Not Detecting Videos

#### Symptoms
- Extension icon remains gray/inactive
- No videos appear in the popup
- "No videos detected" message

#### Solutions
1. **Refresh the page** - Video detection starts when the page loads
2. **Play the video** - Some sites only load video URLs when playback begins
3. **Check supported formats** - We support HLS (.m3u8), DASH (.mpd), and direct video files
4. **Try incognito mode** - Other extensions might interfere
5. **Clear browser cache** - Cached requests might not trigger detection

### Native Host Connection Issues

#### Symptoms
- "Native Host: Disconnected" in extension popup
- Downloads fail with "Native host error"
- Extension popup shows connection error

#### Solutions

##### 1. Verify Installation
```bash
# macOS
/Applications/MAX\ Video\ Downloader.app/Contents/MacOS/mvdcoapp -version

# Windows  
"C:\Program Files\MaxVideoDownloader\mvdcoapp.exe" -version

# Linux
/opt/MaxVideoDownloader/mvdcoapp -version
```

##### 2. Reinstall Native Host
```bash
# Uninstall first
mvdcoapp -uninstall

# Then reinstall
mvdcoapp -install
```

##### 3. Check Browser Registration
```bash
# See which browsers are detected
mvdcoapp -detect-browsers

# Force reinstall for specific browser
mvdcoapp -install --browser chrome
```

### Download Failures

#### Symptoms
- Downloads start but fail partway through
- "FFmpeg error" messages
- Corrupted or incomplete video files

#### Solutions
1. **Check disk space** - Ensure sufficient storage for the video
2. **Try different quality** - Lower quality might work better
3. **Check video URL** - Some streams expire quickly
4. **Restart browser** - Clear any cached connection issues
5. **Update native host** - Download latest version

### Permission Issues

#### macOS: "App can't be opened"
```bash
# Allow the app to run
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/MAX\ Video\ Downloader.app

# Or right-click ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Open anyway
```

#### Windows: "Windows protected your PC"
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"
3. Or run installer as administrator

#### Linux: Permission denied
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x /opt/MaxVideoDownloader/mvdcoapp

# Check ownership
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/MaxVideoDownloader/
```
