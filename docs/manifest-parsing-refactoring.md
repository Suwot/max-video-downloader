# Manifest Parsing Flow Refactoring

## Overview

The manifest parsing system has been refactored to follow a simplified two-stage approach:

1. **Light Parsing**: Quick determination of manifest type (master/variant)
2. **Full Parsing**: Complete processing for master playlists to extract variants

## Key Changes

### Simplified Processing Flow

- Consolidated manifest parsing into two distinct stages
- Removed redundant intermediate functions
- Standardized object structures across both stages
- Added consistent property names and type information

### Enhanced Caching

- Added timestamp-based expiration for cached content
- Created a centralized manifest content cache
- Optimized by reusing cached content across different parsing stages

### Improved Object Structure

- Enhanced video object with standardized fields
- Added calculated fields like estimated size based on bandwidth and duration
- Normalized properties like `isMasterPlaylist`/`isVariant`
- Added format information for better user experience

### New Utility Functions

- `getVariantOptions`: Retrieves formatted variant options
- `getBestQualityVariant`: Selects highest quality variant
- `estimateFileSize`: Calculates file size from bandwidth and duration
- `formatFileSize`: Creates human-readable size representation

### Performance Optimizations

- Range requests for light parsing (only fetches the first 4KB)
- Proper timeout handling for network requests
- Reuse of cached content across parsing stages

## Integration Points

- Maintains backward compatibility with existing consumers
- Preserves existing public API while enhancing internal implementation
- Standardized return formats for reliable integration

## Future Improvements

- Further error handling refinements
- Native code integration updates
- More sophisticated caching strategies
