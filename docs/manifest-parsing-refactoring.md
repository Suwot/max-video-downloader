# Manifest Parsing Flow Refactoring

## Overview

The manifest parsing system has been refactored to follow a simplified two-stage approach:

1. **Light Parsing**: Quick determination of manifest type (master/variant)
2. **Full Parsing**: Complete processing for master playlists to extract variants

## Key Changes

### Simplified Processing Flow

- Consolidated manifest parsing into two distinct stages
- Removed redundant intermediate functions
- Standardized object structures across both stages
- Added consistent property names and type information

### Enhanced Caching

- Added timestamp-based expiration for cached content
- Created a centralized manifest content cache
- Optimized by reusing cached content across different parsing stages

### Improved Object Structure

- Enhanced video object with standardized fields
- Added calculated fields like estimated size based on bandwidth and duration
- Normalized properties like `isMaster`/`isVariant`
- Added format information for better user experience

### New Utility Functions

- `getVariantOptions`: Retrieves formatted variant options
- `getBestQualityVariant`: Selects highest quality variant
- `estimateFileSize`: Calculates file size from bandwidth and duration
- `formatFileSize`: Creates human-readable size representation

### Enhanced Metadata Handling

- **Standardized Metadata Structure**: Consistent metadata structure across both parsing stages
- **HLS-Specific Properties**:
  - `mediaSequence`: Sequence number of the first segment in a variant playlist
  - `targetDuration`: Maximum segment duration for HLS variants
  - `version`: HLS protocol version
  - `playlistType`: Indicates 'master' or 'variant' for more explicit typing
- **DASH-Specific Properties**:
  - `version`: DASH manifest version
  - `totalDuration`: Total presentation duration calculated from manifest
  - `segmentCount`: Estimated number of segments based on duration calculations

### Processing State Management

- **Consistent Processing Flags**:
  - `isLightParsed`: Indicates completion of light parsing stage
  - `isFullyParsed`: Indicates completion of full parsing stage
  - `needsMetadata`: Flag for videos requiring additional metadata extraction
  - `needsPreview`: Flag for videos requiring thumbnail generation
  - `processed`: Main status indicator for completed processing pipeline
- **Image Handling**:
  - `poster`: Main thumbnail image for displaying in UI
  - `previewUrl`: Secondary image reference, made consistent with poster for streaming media
  - For streaming media (HLS/DASH), both fields contain the same image data
  - For direct types, may contain different images depending on source

### Performance Optimizations

- Range requests for light parsing (only fetches the first 4KB)
- Proper timeout handling for network requests
- Reuse of cached content across parsing stages

### Caching Improvements

- **Time-based Content Caching**:
  - Added `manifestContentCache` with 5-minute expiration time
  - Prevents redundant fetches of the same manifest within a short timeframe
  - Reduces network load and speeds up repeat operations
- **Optimized Fetching**:
  - Added `getManifestContent()` helper that uses Range requests when possible
  - Allows for efficient light parsing by fetching only the manifest header when supported
  - Falls back to full fetching when Range requests aren't supported
- **Rich Metadata Caching**:
  - Caches extracted metadata to speed up processing of related manifests
  - Maintains relationship mappings between master playlists and their variants
  - Preserves parsing state to avoid redundant processing

### Error Handling

- **Enhanced Error Recovery**:
  - Added explicit try/catch blocks around network and parsing operations
  - Provides detailed error logging for debugging
  - Ensures errors in one manifest don't affect processing of others
- **Graceful Fallbacks**:
  - When light parsing fails, falls back to full parsing
  - When full parsing fails, uses light parsing results if available
  - Returns standardized video objects even in partial failure scenarios

## Impact & Benefits

The refactoring of the manifest parsing flow delivers several key benefits:

### Performance Improvements

- **Reduced Network Traffic**: By implementing content caching with expiration, network requests are minimized for frequently accessed manifests
- **Faster Processing**: Two-stage parsing approach allows quick identification of video types without full parsing overhead
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Range requests fetch only necessary data for light parsing, reducing bandwidth usage

### Code Quality & Maintainability

- **Consistent Data Model**: Standardized object structure makes the codebase more predictable and easier to maintain
- **Clear Processing States**: Well-defined states (isLightParsed, isFullyParsed) make the code's behavior more transparent
- **Simplified Integration**: The standardizeVideoObject function provides a single point for ensuring consistency

### User Experience

- **More Reliable Metadata**: Enhanced metadata extraction provides better information for user display (quality, size estimates)
- **Faster UI Updates**: Light parsing allows quick display of basic information while full details are being processed
- **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks ensure users still get functional results even when optimal parsing isn't possible

### Future Extensibility

- **Support for New Formats**: The standardized approach makes it easier to add support for new streaming formats
- **Easier Testing**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase more testable
- **Simplified Analytics**: Consistent metadata fields enable better tracking and analysis of user behavior

## Integration Points

- Maintains backward compatibility with existing consumers
- Preserves existing public API while enhancing internal implementation
- Standardized return formats for reliable integration

## Future Improvements

- Further error handling refinements
- Native code integration updates
- More sophisticated caching strategies
