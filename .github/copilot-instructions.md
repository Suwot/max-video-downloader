## PROJECT OVERVIEW

It's a **Chrome MV3 extension** designed to download **HLS**, **DASH**, and **direct video/audio**. It communicates with a **Node.js-powered native host** bundled with `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` for efficient media processing.

The UI follows **modern UX/UI standards**: minimal, responsive, fast, and clean—with proper animation and structural clarity.

## CODING STANDARDS

- reuse existing code, instead of creating new code
- strive for streamlining data flow and function calls patterns
- general flow robustness and simplicity is my priority
- always keep in mind best practices in the industry
- when substituting functions, avoid creating thin wrappers
- think out of the box when looking for solutions
- analyze current data flow and function call stack before jumping to conclusions
- strive for simple solutions, avoid complexity
- always add precise data instead of mock values, use null for missing info instead of empty strings or 0, when appropriate
- use ES6+ syntax, HTML5, CSS3, and JS best practices
- critically evaluate all input and corrections from me, I might be mistaken, confused or even wrong and mislead you, stay focused on best practices and the project goals
- when you need to substitute a function, first perform a search in the codebase via terminal command to quickly find all instances and decide on the best approach to quickly and reliably update all of them

Avoid repeating yourself, show me insights and groud your suggestions in the context of the project.

## RESPONSES

- when applicable, provide structural changes overview for proposed changes (which files are affected, where to create new files, etc.) – so I can provide you with relevant context for manipulations
- when applicable, outline implementation order in simple steps (bold titles, regular body) with bullet lists for each step about what needs to be done in order
- when applicable, provide code snippets with comments
