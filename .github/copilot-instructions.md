# PROJECT OVERVIEW

I'm building a Chrome MV3 extension which downloads HLS, DASH and direct video files. It uses native host for ffmpeg and ffprobe, packed with node.js. The goal is to make it run fast, providing best possible results.

The UI follows best UX/UI practices, with a focus on simplicity and beautiful styles/animations.

# CODING PREFERENCES

- Use ES6+ syntax and features, HTML5 and CSS3 standards.
- Prefer reusing existing functions and code where possible.
- Avoid creating new functions unless necessary â€“ and only after my explicit confirmation.
- Plan your changes before coding.
- Add filename and specific function/variables names when you propose changes.
- If the function grows too large and assigns many roles, check existing flow to find opportunities to split it into smaller functions, simplifying the code and separating concerns.
- Avoid not requested changes to the code.
- Avoid using third-party libraries unless explicitly requested.
- Bring up optimization opportunities, especially for performance improvements.
- Stop and ask if you have multiple ways to implement a feature.
- Separate implementation into small, manageable steps. I prefer code quality over writing speed.
- When proposing changes, provide brief comparison of the current and new code.
- Always weigh proposed changes by impact on performance and difficulty of implementation, show your estimation in the plan.
- Strive for simple and robust solutions with as little code as possible.
- Before writing new code, consider if existing code can be reused or adapted.
