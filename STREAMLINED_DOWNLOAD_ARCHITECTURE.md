# Streamlined Download Flow Architecture

## Overview

Implemented a simplified, professional download flow that eliminates complexity while maintaining reliability. The flow follows your requested pattern: **Click → NHS → Native Host → Progress Stream → UI Mapping**.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Single Source of Truth

- **NHS (ui-communication.js)** holds the `activeDownloads` Map
- Prevents duplicate downloads automatically
- Tracks download state centrally

### 2. Event-Driven Progress

- No polling - pure event-driven architecture
- Progress flows naturally from Native Host → NHS → UI
- Only maps progress when popup is open

### 3. Clear Responsibilities

#### Background (NHS - ui-communication.js)

- **Single Responsibility**: Manage downloads and broadcast progress
- Receives download requests from popup
- Maintains activeDownloads map for duplicate prevention
- Communicates with Native Host
- Broadcasts progress to all connected popups
- Handles notifications

#### Popup (download-streamlined.js)

- **Single Responsibility**: Send requests and map UI progress
- Sends download requests to NHS
- Maps progress messages to UI elements when popup is open
- Handles UI state transitions (downloading/complete/error)

#### UI Elements (video-type-renderers.js)

- **Single Responsibility**: Create download buttons and handle clicks
- Creates download buttons with proper metadata
- Delegates download handling to download module

## Key Benefits

### Reduced Complexity

- **3 core files** instead of 5+ handling downloads
- **Linear flow** instead of branched routing
- **Single state map** instead of multiple trackers

### Better Performance

- **No polling** - event-driven only
- **Lazy UI sync** - only when popup open
- **Automatic cleanup** - completed downloads removed

### Maintainability

- **Clear SRP** - each module has one responsibility
- **Simple debugging** - linear data flow
- **Predictable behavior** - no hidden state management

## Files Modified

1. **ui-communication.js** - Added `handleDownloadRequest()` function
2. **download-streamlined.js** - New simplified download module
3. **index.js** - Simplified message handling for progress mapping
4. **video-type-renderers.js** - Updated import to use streamlined module

## Trade-offs Accepted

1. **Progress only visible when popup open** - Acceptable since user needs popup to see downloads
2. **Background holds download state** - Minimal memory impact, enables duplicate prevention
3. **Simplified error handling** - Focus on core functionality over edge cases

## Migration Path

- Current files can be gradually deprecated
- `download.js` can be removed after testing
- Flow is backward compatible with existing UI

This architecture achieves your goal of **simple, streamlined, professional** download handling while maintaining reliability and following SRP principles.
